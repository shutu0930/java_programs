/* 
 * The calculateMark method must return the MarkGrade based on the following:
 * 
 * + the "lab", "assignment1" and "assignment2" marks are between 0 and 10 (inclusive).
 * + the "finalexam" is between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
 * 
 * If any of these components are not within the expected range then an ComponentOutOfRangeException is thrown.
 * 
 * If a student does not attend the final exam (attendedFinal will be false) then a grade of NCN should be given and
 * the final mark must be set to null.
 * 
 * The lab mark is worth 10% of the final grade and marked out of 10, 
 * the assignments are worth 15% each of the final grade and marked out of 10, and
 * the final exam is worth 60% and marked out of 100.  These marks are combined EXACTLY 
 * and then rounded to produce an integer out of 100 (round up for values exactly 
 * half way between integer values).   Once this is done
 * the grade can be determined using the following ranges:
 *  + 0-44 N
 *  + 45-49 PX
 *  + 50-59 P
 *  + 60-69 C
 *  + 70-79 D
 *  + 80-100 HD
 *  
 *  Note that there will also be some scaling involved in calculating the final mark in this actual course, 
 *  however, lets not worry about this for this lab exercise.
